Redesign of Louisville Youth Group's website for the Front-End Development track at Code Louisville.

A redesign of Louisville Youth Group's website.

The focus of this project was to meet the requirements of Code Louisville's Front-End Development track, while learning along the way. There is still much work to be done - content and structural work as well as detail-level styling - but I have learned a lot with this project.

I have used custom CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive design that has elements of interactivity such as responsive navigation, form validation, and animated text. My next steps with this project will be to rearrange the CSS for efficiency, include SCSS, and add additional content.

Hopefully this project will follow me into the Full-Stack JavaScript track in Code Louisville, where I will be able to make it more robust and ready to use.

My biggest challenges with this project were with my custom JavaScript related to the responsive navigation. I made the mistake of switching methods halfway through and had leftover code in both my JS and CSS that caused errors. This was a learning opportunity, though, and my takeaway was: if you're switching methods, just start over.
